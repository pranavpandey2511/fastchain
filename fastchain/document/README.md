# Document and Chunk class types explained

## Document

In the `base.py` file, we have defined a base class `Document` for all documents. This class includes common attributes and methods that all documents should have. It serves as a blueprint for creating more specific document classes.

In the `chunk/schema.py` file, located in the `chunk` folder, we have defined a base `Chunk` class. This class is used to validate and deserialize input data, and to serialize output data. It includes methods for validating the data against the schema, and for handling any errors that occur during validation. This base schema class is extended by other, more specific schema classes to create schemas for specific types of documents.

Each specific schema class defines the fields that a document of its type should have, the type of each field, and any additional constraints or requirements for each field. For example, a schema for a blog post document might include fields for the title, the content, the author, and the date of publication. The schema would specify that the title and content are strings, the author is a user object, and the date of publication is a date.

These schemas are used throughout the application to ensure that the data is consistent and valid. They are used when creating new documents, when updating existing documents, and when retrieving documents from the database. By using these schemas, we can ensure that the data in our application is always in the correct format, and that it meets all of our requirements.
